# /jam-tools/

### Isomorphic utilities for your web application

Full-stack development becomes much simpler when you can reduce the total amount of used approaches and technologies in your project. One of the coolest thing in JavaScript - is that you can use the same modules in your front-end and in your back-end code at the same time. This helps to make your code more reliable and comfortable to maintain. This helps to give more attention to your business tasks and to keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

JAM - means JavaScript + API + Markup. This development approach was born as an answer to over-complication trend in modern web development. So, `/jam-tools/` - is a set of simple JavaScript modules for the most of the major tasks you need to complete when you build your JAM-stack solution.

Possible purposes:
- Assets minification
- Template tools
- Build utilities
- Node.js DOM API connectors for the headless browsers
- Cloud file management
- etc.
