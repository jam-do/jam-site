### HTML as low code

HTML - is simple to understand. All web sites and applications are started from HTML documents. It's easy to explain to everyone, how do HTML-tags work. Even if you are not an experienced developer, you can create simple web page using simple tags. You can compose elements and place them in hierarchy as you need. 

But standard HTML - is not a programming language, it doesn't support such things as:

- External modules connection
- Reusable components
- Logical operators
- Data bindings
- Iterators
- etc.

It's good that now, all modern browsers are support the approach to extend HTML to feat all that things and even more possible requirements.

No-code and low-code approaches are getting popular nowadays. It's positioned as the tools, which could be helpful for the wider range of people, who want to build something. But the most of them has one disadvantage: when you want to build something more specific and custom, the solution becomes to look like programming and appear more complicated, than the programming itself.

So we introduce our solution - &lt;jam-x&gt; - the set of HTML extensions, that can help you to build almost everything, without any conceptual limitations. Just collect your blocks and place them together, like a toy constructor. And your browser - is almost all you need to do that. Now you can code as a true developer, but with a fantastic level of simplicity.

### What's under the hood?

&lt;jam-x&gt; is based on&nbsp;[Symbiote.js](https://symbiotejs.org/)&nbsp;library, which is created for the advanced integration purposes in front-end development. The core feature of Symbiote.js - is that Symbiote-components are able to analyse their own environment and usage context. And those components could be represented as custom HTML-tags in the source document.

This technology is well-tested and work perfectly in the huge amount of cases.
