### What exactly we doing?
Our goal is to create the new kind of web development platform. We rethinking and reassembling environment tools to make them more clear and useful for the wider range of interested people, not for the web developers only.

We are not trying to reinvent the wheel. All our solutions are based on the modern abilities and standards, such as Web Components, HTTPS-imports, ECMAScript Modules, Git, CDNs and blockchain.

- JavaScript is a new PHP - use the full power of programming for the all types of your text assets 
- Integrated teams - build your team with a smart contracts 
- Integrated financial model - own your contributions as NFTs
- DBD - Designed by Data - don't waste your time to complicated design, let your data create the UI for you
- Talk with your app - dialog interfaces allows to unite rich representations and the ability to manage your application data
- Meta Web - integrate your solution into any other applications. Get yours from the set of ready-made blocks, developed by the other teams
- AI - ask machine to build the new blocks for you

### What the state of our platform?
Currently, almost all we plan to offer is at the development stage. 

We have some POCs, and preparing them for demonstration. Don't go away for a long and you'll see that!
