We searching for the partners and investors for our project - the new kind of web-development platform. We want to recompose some of well-known principles in a new form, to make web-development more accessible for the wider range audience and to seamlessly integrate the blockchain and AI tools into the process.

This is a list of main elements of our concept:
- HTML-based Low-Code approach to speed-up and simplify the process without a lack of flexibility or some mature development practices
- Smart CDN for the web-assets connection and build-and-cache purposes
- Automated tokenization of development artifacts, built-in blockchain economics, project and team management
- AI tools for the accessibility maximization
- AI tools for the automated web-asset generation

Please, feel free to contact us if you are interested or want to participate.
